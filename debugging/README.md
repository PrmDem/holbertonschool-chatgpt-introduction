# Debugging ft. ChatGPT
The following tasks are all to be checked and debugged using ChatGPT, so that we can learn how to prompt it, verify its suggestions and outputs, and automise time-consuming tasks with it.<br/>
Therefore and in compliance with the teachings of this project, the rest of this readme is written by the machine itself.<br/>
## Tasks Overview
Here is a list of the tasks in this repository:

### 1. Change Background Color in HTML (Frontend Task)
Description: A simple task where the background color of a webpage is changed using JavaScript.<br/>
Debugging with ChatGPT: Helped resolve issues with the JavaScript code not properly triggering the background change.

### 2. Check for Invalid Input in Checkbook Account Balancing Program
Description: A program designed to help balance a checkbook account, ensuring that the input for transaction amounts is valid (i.e., that it consists only of numbers).<br/>
Debugging with ChatGPT: ChatGPT assisted in improving the input validation logic, handling cases where users accidentally entered non-numeric values or left fields empty.
### 3. Implement Factorial Function (Iterative and Recursive)
Description: Implementations of the factorial function, both iteratively and recursively.<br/>
Debugging with ChatGPT: Assisted in improving edge cases handling (e.g., negative numbers or zero) and ensured both methods were optimized for performance and clarity.
### 4. Debug Minesweeper Game - Victory Condition
Description: A Minesweeper game where the player needs to avoid mines and reveal safe cells.<br/>
Debugging with ChatGPT: The game lacked a victory condition that would trigger when all non-mine cells were revealed. ChatGPT helped add this missing condition and ensured the game logic correctly identified victory.
### 5. Tic Tac Toe Game
Description: A console-based game of Tic Tac Toe, where two players alternate marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.<br/>
Debugging with ChatGPT: ChatGPT helped fix a bug where the program did not correctly check the right player on a victory condition, and assisted in cleaning up user input and improving overall gameplay logic.
